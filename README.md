#  Nexa - Your Personal Assistant

Nexa is a lightweight, voice-activated AI assistant built with Python. Inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Marvel universe, Nexa is designed to perform simple tasks, understand voice commands, and speak responses using real-time speech recognition and text-to-speech engines.

This is the first stage of building a personalized digital assistant that can interact naturally and perform basic automation.
